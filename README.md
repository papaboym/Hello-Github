# Hello-Github
Hello World!
Im Parham Nabati.This is my FIRST Github file,project,commit and repository:)
I want to use Github as a progress bar of my learning progress. so i will upload any project I will made. maybe simple as HelloWorld.py:)
I hope that someday I can code like a professional and type English without Google Translate!
(I wrote this README without GoogleTranslate so congrats to me:) and exuse me if there was any mistake!)
